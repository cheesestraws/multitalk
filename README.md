# Introduction

[![Build Status](https://cloud.drone.io/api/badges/sfiera/multitalk/status.svg)](https://cloud.drone.io/sfiera/multitalk)

MultiTalk is a repeater for different transports for AppleTalk:
* EtherTalk, spoken by Classic MacOS or netatalk2 machines over Ethernet
* LocalTalk-over-UDP (LTOU) multicast, spoken by Mini vMac 37+
* TCP, spoken by the `kwai` component of bbraunâ€™s abridge

# Usage

Convert between EtherTalk and LTOU on the ethernet port:

    sudo multitalk --ethertalk eth0 --multicast eth0

The same, except printing all packets for debugging:

    sudo multitalk -e eth0 -m eth0 --debug
